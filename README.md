3D Sphere Volume Autoencoder		

Project Overview			

This project generates synthetic 3D volumes containing randomly placed and sized spheres, and then trains an autoencoder on this dataset. The autoencoder aims to learn efficient representations of the 3D data, useful for dimensionality reduction, denoising, or anomaly detection in volumetric data. This project is particularly relevant for fields like medical imaging, 3D modeling, and scientific research. A significant emphasis is placed on unit testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of both the dataset generation and the autoencoder model.
